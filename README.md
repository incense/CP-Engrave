# CP-Engrave
Font for cockpit panels.
I will use it for F16 panels used in Falcon-BMS.
The font itself is on the 'light' side, as the laser engraving will make it a bit 'bolder' by 0.15 mm per side.

## CP Engrave Font.svg
Started to design the font in Inkscape.

## CP Engrave.sfd
Loaded the svg font from above into fontforge, to do some fine tuning.
Intention was to adjust kerning and line spacing, unfortunately this doesn't work as intended.

## CP_Engrave.otf
The font file to be used in e.g. Windows.
This file has been created by fontforge.

## F16_test-panel.odg
Testing the font libreoffice paint, picture of the test panel is from Falcon BMS documentation scaled to 1:1.
